# Secret-Salad-Generator
### Javascript Challenge - Password Generator ðŸ¥—

## Description

This project was more challenging than the others, I have to admit at the beginning I really didn't know how to do the logic to generate a random password with criteria given my the user.
I used what we have learned in class to store the data and loop to generate the final password. I also had to do validations before generating it to make sure the project didn't crash or show wrong data.
This challenge was fun!

## Usage

After running the project you will be able to access the site. In this site you will be able to generate your salad (random password).
The site will prompt some alerts to get your input on some of the decisions like size, and characters to be included.
Below I show how the site looks at the begining, how the alerts are prompted and an example of a password generated:
